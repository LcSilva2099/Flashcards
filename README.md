When learning a new language, it can be hard to remember all the new vocabulary, which is exactly where flashcards 
can help. Typically, flashcards show a hint (a task or a picture) on one side and the right answer on the other. 

'add' to add a card:
'remove' to remove a card: 
'load' to load cards from file
'save' cards to file
'ask' to ask for a definition of some random cards
'exit' to exit the program
'log' to save the application log to the given file
'hardest card' to print the term of the card that has the most mistakes
'reset stats' to erase the mistake counts for all cards


To read an initial cards set from an external file, you should pass the argument -import and follow it with the file name
If the -export argument is set and it is followed by the file name
